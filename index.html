           Alan Turing was born at Paddington, London. His father, Julius Mathison Turing, was a British member of the Indian Civil Service and he was often abroad. Alan's mother, Ethel Sara Stoney, was the daughter of the chief engineer of the Madras railways and Alan's parents had met and married in India. When Alan was about one year old his mother rejoined her husband in India, leaving Alan in England with friends of the family. 
        </p>
        <p>1926: Turing was bicing 60 miles per day in order to get to school due to a strike. Turing was an exceptional athlete throughout his life, almost olympic level.</p>
        <p>1926-1929: he read Einstein's papers on relativity and he also read about quantum mechanics in Eddington's The nature of the physical world. </p>
       <p>1933: He read Bertrand Russell's <i>Introduction to mathematical philosophy</i> and von Neumann's 1932 text on quantum mechanics, a subject he returned to a number of times throughout his life.</p> 
        <p>1934: Turing graduated </p>
         <p>1935: he attended Max Newman's advanced course on the foundations of mathematics. This course studied GÃ¶del's incompleteness results and Hilbert's question on decidability.</p>
        <p>1935: Turing was elected a fellow of King's College, Cambridge, for a dissertation <i>On the Gaussian error function</i> which proved fundamental results on probability theory, namely the central limit theorem. Although the central limit theorem had recently been discovered, Turing was not aware of this and discovered it independently. 
          </p>
          <p>1936: Turing was a Smith's Prizeman.</p>
        <p>
          1936: he published <i>On Computable Numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem</i>. It is in this paper that Turing introduced an abstract machine, now called a <strong>"Turing machine"</strong>, which moved from one state to another using a precise finite set of rules (given by a finite table) and depending on a single symbol it read from a tape.
        </p>
          <p>
            1936-1939: discussions about Computable Numbers with Church lead Alan to Priceton where he complete his PhD publishing his thesis <i>Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals</i>. 
          </p>
       <p>1938: While at Princeton Turing had played with the idea of constructing a computer. Once back at Cambridge he started to build an analogue mechanical device to investigate the Riemann hypothesis, which many consider today the biggest unsolved problem in mathematics.</p>
        <p>
          1939-1945: When war was declared in 1939 Turing immediately moved to work full-time at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park. Although the work carried out at Bletchley Park was covered by the Official Secrets Act, much has recently become public knowledge.
        </p>
         <p>
           1946: The National Laboraty of Physics of London proposed Alan Turing to design a computer. The Insitute regarded the design of the memory of the device as hopelessly over-ambitious and the approval of the proejct got delayed. 
           </p>
          <p>1947: Turing returned to Cambridge for the academic year 1947-48 where he zoomed in neurology and physiology. He did not forget about computers during this period, however, and he wrote code for programming computers. He finished fifth place in a marathon. </p>
          <p>
             1950: Turing published <i>Computing machinery and intelligence</i> in Mind. It is another remarkable work from his brilliantly inventive mind which seemed to foresee the questions which would arise as computers developed. He studied problems which today lie at the heart of artificial intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>1952 he published the first part of his theoretical study of morphogenesis, the development of pattern and form in living organisms, the result of his work on the application of mathematical theory to biological forms.</p>
